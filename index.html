      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to my personal website! I'm a coterminal master's student at
        Stanford University who is passionate about AI and it's use in language,
        robotic planning, and vision.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm finishing up my last undergraduate computer science requirements
        this Winter Quarter and plan to offically earn my Bachelor's in April
        2024, and plan to earn my Master's degree by December 2024
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm currently looking for internships for the summer, and am also on the
        lookout for full-time opportunities starting as soon as this Autumn in
        case there may be a good match
      </p>

      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <p>Here are some of the projects I'm working on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Stanford Robotics Club Student-Led Course Project: Pupperception
          <a href="https://github.com/rydwy01/PupperPerception/tree/master"
            >Project 1</a
          >
          Built a quadruped (four-legged) robot that we called "pupper",
          programmed its basic motion control, and attached a camera to it so
          that it could use computer vision techniques to detect a human in
          front of it and orient itself toward them by moving its legs and
          turning in a circle.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stanford CS 224N Course Project, Paper, and Poster Presentation:
          Multilingual MinBERT
          <a
            href="https://github.com/rydwy01/cs224n-final-project/blob/main/Final%20Paper.pdf"
            >Multilingual MinBERT</a
          >
          Created a small-scale minBERT model and experimented with ensembling
          of a multilingual model pretrained on French data to perform on a set
          of 3 NLP tasks
        </li>
      </ul>
